        ## First Thing First!

        Before filing any issue, ask yourself:
        - Are you sure the package is not built by Snigdha OS? (e.g stacer) 
        - Are you sure the package comes built-in with Snigdha OS?
        - Do I have basic ideas about where it goes wrong? (e.g crashing)
        - Could it be because of my own mistakes?

        **The GitHub issue tracker is not a support forum**. If you are not sure whether it could be your mistakes, ask in the [Snigdha OS Forum](https://forum.snigdhaos.org/) first. The quickest way to verify whether the problem is of Snigdha OS is through a **reproduction**, starting with a fresh installation(note: install on virtual machine) and making changes until the bug is reproduced.

        Make the bug obvious. Ideally, we should be able to understand it without running any code.

        Bugs are fixed faster if you include:
        - A repro repository to inspect the code
        - An url to see the problem live (if possible)

        > **What happens if you skip this step?** Someone will read your bug report, and maybe will be able to help you, but itâ€™s unlikely that it will get much attention from the team. Eventually, the issue will likely get closed in favor of issues that have reproducible demos.

        Please remember that:

        - Issues without reproducible demos have a very low priority.
        - The person fixing the bug would have to do that anyway. Please be respectful of their time.
        - You might figure out the issues yourself as you work on extracting it.

        Thanks for helping us help you!
