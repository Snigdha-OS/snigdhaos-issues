        > **What happens if you skip this step?** Someone will read your bug report, and maybe will be able to help you, but itâ€™s unlikely that it will get much attention from the team. Eventually, the issue will likely get closed in favor of issues that have reproducible demos.

        Please remember that:

        - Issues without reproducible demos have a very low priority.
        - The person fixing the bug would have to do that anyway. Please be respectful of their time.
        - You might figure out the issues yourself as you work on extracting it.

        Thanks for helping us help you!
